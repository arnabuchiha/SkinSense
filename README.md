# Skin Sense: A Skin Cancer Detection App

## Problem Statement
Skin Cancer is the most common cancer and is often
ignored by people at an early stage. An estimated
178,560 cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the
U.S. in 2018. If melanoma is recognized and treated
early, it is almost always curable, but if it is not, the
cancer can advance and spread to other parts of the
body, where it becomes hard to treat and can be fatal.

## Solution
Melanoma, if treated early, could be cured. Our
application, with 84.7% accuracy is capable
enough to classify Melanoma skin cancer even at
an early stage remotly. One can easily classify
the type of cancer as Melanoma or not and can
take actions accordingly.
